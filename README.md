This CPU works in cycles and breaks tasks into steps to get the tasks done.
8-bit multicycle CPUs are used in embedded systems, microcontrollers, and applications where efficiency and simplicity are crucial. In the CPU, the multi-cycle part means that each job requires several steps to be done, and there is a trade-off between how fast the job runs and how complex it is.
